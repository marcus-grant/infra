# marcus_grant.ops.containerd

A role to setup containerd based systems on a machine.
Mainly rancher desktop, nerdctl, etc.
Good for macOS that needs some finagling to get containerd/docker/kubernetes.

## Requirements

None

## Role Variables

These are the default variables for this role as visible in `defaults/main.yml`.
If a variable is required, it won't have a default value.


| Variable               | Default | Choices | Comments                             |
| ---------------------- | ------- | ------- | ------------------------------------ |
| containerd_packages   | `sudo`  | str     | Group owner, mac has NO sudo         |
| profile_paths          | `[]`    | [str]   | Add to PATH (earlier override later) |
| profile_lc_all         | `*`     | str     | LC_ALL value, override all locale    |
| profile_editor         | `vim`   | str     | Default editor command               |
| profile_ls_colors      | `^`     | str     | Default editor command               |
| profile_xdg_include    | `false` | bool    | *See below XDG section*              |
| profile_envs           | `[]`    | [{}]    | *See Custom Environment Variables*   |
| profile_custom_entries | `[]`    | []      | *See Custom Entries Section*         |

> `*`: Shortens default string of `en_US.UTF-8`.
> `^`: Shortens the default LS_COLORS string shown in `defaults/main.yml` of role.
> ... it's quite long, no need to show here.

### Role Variables (XDG)

These variables are specific to XDG environment variable definitions.
These can be defined or ignored according to `profile_xdg_include`.
It's a good idea to use `$HOME` when the path is relevant to user home.

| Variable    | Default          | Choices | Comments                       |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ------- | ------------------------------ |
| include     | `false`          | bool    | If to include XDG definitions  |
| config_home | *`/.config`      | str     | `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` path string  |
| data_home   | *`/.local/share` | str     | `XDG_DATA_HOME` path string    |
| cache_home  | *`/.cache`       | str     | `XDG_CACHE_HOME` path string   |
| bin_home    | *`/.local/bin`   | str     | `XDG_BIN_HOME` path string     |
| runtime_dir | *`/.cache/run`   | str     | `XDG_RUNTIME_HOME` path string |

> `_abc`: Shortens the role prefix of the XDG variables, ie `profile_xdg_abc`
> `*`: Shortens default path prefix `$HOME`.

### Role Variables (Custom Environment Variables)

Custom environment variables can be added to the `profile_env` variable as
a list of dictionaries.
The dictionary must have a `name` and `value` key,
representing the environment variable name and value respectively.
The order determines where in the file the variable is defined, earliest first.

```yaml
profile_envs:
  - name: "MY_VAR"
    value: "my value"
  - {name: "MY_VAR2", value: "my value 2"}
```

### Role Variables (Custom Profile Entries)

These are custom line-by-line entries that gets added to the end of the profile.
They're stored as a list of strings, with each string representing a line,
in the order they will be added to the profile.

```yaml
profile_custom_entries:
  - "hello='Hello World!'"
  - "echo $hello"
  - "/some/script/path/startup-script.sh"
```

## Example Playbook

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

```yaml
- hosts: all
  vars:  # Most taken from defaults/main.yml
    profile_group: sudo  # Remember macOS doesn't have this, maybe use staff, wheel or admin
    profile_paths: []  # List of paths to add to $PATH, earlier overrides later
    profile_lc_all: en_US.UTF-8
    profile_xdg_include: false
    profile_xdg_config_home: $HOME/.config  # Defines XDG_CONFIG_HOME
    profile_xdg_data_home: $HOME/.local/share  # Defines XDG_DATA_HOME
    profile_xdg_cache_home: $HOME/.cache  # Defines XDG_CACHE_HOME
    profile_xdg_bin_home: $HOME/.local/bin  # Defines XDG_BIN_HOME
    profile_xdg_runtime_dir: $HOME/.cache/run  # Defines XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
    profile_editor: vim
    profile_envs:
    - name: "MY_VAR"
      value: "my value"
    - {name: "MY_VAR2", value: "my value 2"}
    profile_custom_entries:
    - "hello='Hello World!'"
    - "echo $hello"
    - "/some/script/path/startup-script.sh"

  roles:
    - name: marcus_grant.dofiles.profile
```
