# A ansible templated script to UNmount all encrypted drives

# This script makes a few assumptions:
# * The drives all share the same passphrase
# * No external security device is used (think TOTP or HOTP or GPG)
# * All drives are to be mounted in their same respective paths
# * All drives are to be mounted, not a subset
# * The order of all arrays here needs to be preserved
#   * The order represents an ordered set of originating block devices/volumes
